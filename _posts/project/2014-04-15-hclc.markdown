####Haddon Community Learning Centre
The LearnLocal Community Centre at Haddon was running a simple, static, outdated and fairly ugly looking Virb template. (You can see it [here](https://shakna-israel.github.io/hclc_proposal/#/1))

Our original proposal, which you can see [here](https://shakna-israel.github.io/hclc_proposal/), impressed, despite its basic level. From there, we integrated several features:

* Google Calendar integration, seen on the [News]({{ page.website }}/news/) page.
* Markdown Management. Each course is a simple text document, and immediately appears on the [Enrolment]({{ page.website }}/enrolment/) page.
* A Search Engine, based on the RSS feed. Seen on the [Search]({{ page.website }}/search.html) page.
* Click-To-Call links. Seen on the [Contact]({{ page.website }}/contact/) page.
* Git Versioning
